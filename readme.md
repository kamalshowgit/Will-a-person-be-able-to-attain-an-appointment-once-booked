# Predicting No Shows for Medical Appointments

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting no-shows for medical appointments, aiming to improve resource utilization for government-sponsored medical services. These services often struggle with resource shortages due to a lack of medical personnel and challenging living conditions for a significant part of the population. The goal is to create an accurate predictive model that identifies patients who are likely to miss their appointments. To achieve this, we have collected and prepared several datasets containing medical history, demographic details, and appointment information.

## Importance of Resource Planning

Resource planning is a critical aspect of efficient business operations, especially in scenarios where resources are scarce. This project addresses the challenges faced by government-sponsored medical services by leveraging data-driven insights to better allocate resources. By predicting no-shows for appointments, these services can optimize their resource utilization, enhance patient care, and alleviate the strain caused by limited resources.

## Dataset Overview

The project utilizes the following datasets to build and evaluate the predictive model:

- **Medical History**: Contains medical history information (`medical_history.csv`).
- **Demographic Details**: Contains demographic information (`demographic_details.csv`).
- **Train Dataset**: Used for model training (`train.csv`).
- **Test Dataset**: Used for prediction (`test_share.csv`).

## Formal Problem Statement

The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that assesses the probability of no-shows for medical appointments based on various appointment details. The training dataset will serve as the foundation for model development, while the test dataset lacks a response column ("No-show") that needs to be predicted. The prediction results should be submitted in CSV format, following the guidelines provided.

## Advice for Model Building

To enhance the performance of the predictive model, it is recommended to utilize the demographic and medical history data files. These additional data sources can potentially provide valuable insights that contribute to the accuracy of the predictions.

## Code Explanation

The provided code demonstrates the initial steps of data preprocessing and preparation for model building. It includes the following key steps:

1. Data loading and merging: The code loads the training and test datasets, along with medical history and demographic details. These datasets are merged based on the "PatientId" column.

2. Feature engineering: The code performs some initial feature engineering by creating binary columns based on gender and neighborhood information. These engineered features can potentially improve the model's performance.

3. Data cleaning: Irrelevant columns ("PatientId", "AppointmentID", "ScheduledDay", "AppointmentDay") are dropped from the training and test datasets.

4. Data concatenation: The cleaned datasets are concatenated to create a comprehensive dataset ("all_data") that will be used for further analysis and modeling.

5. Categorical encoding: The "Gender" column is transformed into a binary value, and the "Neighbourhood" column is transformed into multiple binary columns based on the most frequent neighborhoods.

6. Target column identification: The target column for prediction is identified as "No-show."

Please note that the provided code is an initial foundation and does not include the entire model building process. Additional steps, such as feature selection, model selection, training, validation, and testing, are needed to create a complete predictive model.
